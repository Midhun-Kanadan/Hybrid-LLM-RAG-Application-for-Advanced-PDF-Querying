## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Hybrid-LLM-RAG-Application-for-Advanced-PDF-Querying** is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to leverage **OpenAI** and **Ollama** language models for advanced querying of PDF documents. This application processes PDF files, generates embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and answers user queries based on document content using state-of-the-art language models.

## ðŸš€ Features

- [x] **Hybrid LLM Support:** Switch seamlessly between OpenAI and Ollama models.
- [x] **PDF Chunking and Querying:** Automatically processes PDF files into chunks for efficient retrieval.
- [x] **Dynamic OpenAI API Configuration:** Load API keys from a `.env` file or input them directly in the application.
- [x] **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- [x] **Real-Time Progress Bar:** Displays step-by-step progress for processing, embedding, and querying.
- [x] **Customizable RAG Settings:** Easily configure the LLM type and model through a sidebar.
- [x] **Embedding Visualization:** Leverage UMAP to visually project query and retrieved embeddings in 2D space, with interactive tooltips displaying document chunks and query text.

## To-Do List

### Enhancements to Add:

- [ ] **Try Different Embeddings:** Experiment with other embedding models like Sentence-BERT, Cohere, or HuggingFace transformers.
- [ ] **Different Chunking Methods:** Implement advanced chunking methods such as semantic chunking or token-based chunking.
- [ ] **Advanced Retrieval Methods:** Incorporate strategies like Multi-Query Retriever or Vector Search with Hybrid Retrieval.
- [ ] **Agentic RAG:** Explore incorporating agents to handle multi-step queries or interact with external APIs dynamically.
- [ ] **Support for Multiple Languages:** Enable processing of documents in languages other than English, such as German, for multilingual support.
